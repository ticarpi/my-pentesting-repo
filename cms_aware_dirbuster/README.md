# cms_aware_dirbuster
> A mini-project to provide a tailored website directory brute-forcer that detects common CMSes or server software and targets the relevant directories and file listings

## Pre-requisites
* Python 2.7+
* Python Requests library

Assuming you have Python installed you can install Requests via Pip:  
*For example on Ubuntu:*
`$ apt-get install python-pip`  
`$ pip install requests`

## Usage
`python cms_aware_dirbuster.py http://example.com (dictionary.lst)`
The *basic.lst* dictionary is used by default - and that is the tailored approach.
However, you can specify your own dictionary if you just want normal *dirbuster* functionality.
